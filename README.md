Hi!! 

These are my notes from the **HSF/IRIS-HEP Software Basics Training at CERN.** It's pretty self explanatory. 

Most of the notes are using **markdown**, and considering it's a programming workshop, I used **jupyter notebooks**. 

A few important things that i must say!!
* All of the material inside the 'material' directory was material given by the speakers, it was **not** written by me. It's just in this repository so I can have everything in one place. 
* The uproot notes are heavily based on 'uproot-awkward-tutorial.ipynb' and most of my notes are in comments inside that file. That's why it isn't on the 'material' directory (but it should be). 
* I apologize for the 'Spanglish', but there isn't much I can do about that now hehe.
